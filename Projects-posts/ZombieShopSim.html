                <h1>What is this?</h1>
                <p>It's a fairly small game project I started on for the purpose of getting a project finished. It's going to be a small shop simulator placed in a zombie apocalypse world. I'm going to be using Synty studios models and variations of them that I will be editing in blender.</p>

                <h1>Progress</h1>
                <p>Progress is going alright as the thing holding me the most back is design. Which is not something I am very good at. I'm expecting the map/design to be very bad but I hope I can improve it over time. Other than design aka the code is going very well. When writing this I'm not having any major issues but I'm struggling to figure out the logic for what I want.</p>
